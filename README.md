## üí° Project Highlights & My Contributions

This project allowed me to apply and strengthen my expertise in several critical areas of data engineering and analytics:

* **Designed and Implemented Medallion Architecture:** I architected and built a multi-layered data warehouse using the **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers within SQL Server, ensuring data quality, scalability, and optimal structure for analytics.
* **Developed End-to-End ETL Pipelines:** Extracting, transforming, and loading data from disparate CSV sources (ERP and CRM) into the data warehouse, performing crucial data cleansing, standardization, and integration.
* **Modeled Business-Ready Data (Star Schema):** I designed and implemented a star schema in the Gold layer, creating optimized fact and dimension tables that significantly simplify analytical queries and improve reporting performance.
* **Delivered Actionable Business Intelligence:** I developed SQL-based analytical reports to provide deep insights into **customer behavior**, **product performance**, and **sales trends**, empowering strategic decision-making.
* **Ensured Data Quality and Integration:** A core focus was on cleansing and resolving data quality issues from source systems and integrating them seamlessly into a unified data model.
* **Produced Comprehensive Documentation:** I created detailed documentation, including data architecture diagrams, data flow, data models (star schema), and naming conventions, crucial for collaboration and maintainability.

## üèóÔ∏è Data Architecture: My Approach

I designed this project's data architecture following the industry-standard Medallion Architecture:


1.  **Bronze Layer**: I set up the ingestion process to store raw data as-is from CSV files directly into a SQL Server Database, ensuring data fidelity from the source.
2.  **Silver Layer**: I implemented processes for data cleansing, standardization, and normalization, meticulously preparing the raw data for downstream analysis and integration.
3.  **Gold Layer**: I meticulously modeled business-ready data into a star schema, specifically optimized for high-performance reporting and analytical queries.
